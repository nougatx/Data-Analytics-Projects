# Career Track Analysis

In this project by 365 Data Science, I analyze the time taken for students to complete each of the Data Analyst, Data Science, and Business Analyst courses and the number of enrollments and average completion per enrollment for each of the mentioned courses.

I used SQL to process the data and select the necessary information. I then used Tableau for visualization.
